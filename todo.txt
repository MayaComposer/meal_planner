# #1. pick a random recipe for monday
# #2. check the ingredients, and if use 1-3 of them to pick the next recipe
#check the fresh ingredients and use those to choose recipes so there is overlap between ingredients
# #3. pick a recipe for tuesday
# 4. take into account fish, meat, vegetarian

#1. loop through the recipes
#2. take 7 random recipes
#3. use different filters (I guess) to check if the recipes are correct
#for example, check there is a max of 2 fish recipes, and if there is more, replace with vegetarian ones until there is 2
#check overlap between fresh ingredients


#other method:

#1. pick 2 fish recipes ✅
#2. pick 1 meat recipe✅
#3. pick 4 vegetarian recipes✅
#4. add it to a list✅
#5. check list to see if there is overlap between fresh ingredients, if so, make sure those recipes are right after each other.

#recipes = dataframe.to_dict('index')


#filter recipes and add them to categories
#for each row, if it is a meat recipe, add to meat recipe list
#do the same for veg
#do the same for fish
